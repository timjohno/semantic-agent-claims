Subject: Insurance Claim Request - Policy Number POL123456

Hi there,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Jane Doe, and I'm writing to file a claim under my insurance policy. I was born on March 10, 1985, and I live at 123 Main St, London.

On May 1, 2025, flooding has occurred as a result of a water leak in my kitchen. I tried to stop it, but it spread quickly and caused a lot of damage to the kitchen and nearby rooms. I had to evacuate for safety.

I've attached some photos of the damage and a copy of the damage report, this is Â£1750. I've also included a list of the items that were damaged and their estimated value.

Please let me know if you need any more information or documents to process my claim. I appreciate your help with this and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks a lot!

Best,

Jane Doe
