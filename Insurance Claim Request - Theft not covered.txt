Subject: Insurance Claim Request - Policy Number POL654321

Hi there,

I hope you're doing well. My name is John Smith, and I'm writing to file a claim under my insurance policy.

On May 1, 2025, some items were stolen from my property.  These included a box of jewelry, my collection of vintage stamps and some cash I was keeping under my bed. I'd like to claim Â£10,000 for theft. 

Please let me know if you need any more information or documents to process my claim. I appreciate your help with this and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks a lot!

Best,

John
