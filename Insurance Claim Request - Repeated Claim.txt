Subject: Insurance Claim Request - Policy Number POL789012

Hi there,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Sarah Wilson, I'm a commercial landlord and one of my tenants at 789 Highstreet Birmingham has flooded the building basement again!

Please let me know if you need any more information or documents to process my claim. I appreciate your help with this and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks a lot!

Best,

Sarah
